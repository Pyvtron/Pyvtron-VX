A cinematic shader designed for visual storytelling, enhanced godrays, depth-of-field and post-processing effects.

## Details

Features: Volumetric Fog, Water Caustics, Volumetric Clouds, High Resolution Graphics.

Performance Impact: High.

## Requirements

AMD CPU or Intel CPU.

Nvidia GPU.

A graphics card that supports OpenGL 4.6

Note: I currently only have access to Nvidia GPUs for testing.

Because of this, I cannot ensure that this shader will work properly for AMD and Intel GPUs.

That said, I will still try to fix any issues that occur for AMD and Intel users.
